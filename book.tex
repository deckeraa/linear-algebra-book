\section{What is Linear Algebra?}
You've probably done algebra before in your life.
You've taken an equation like $x + 2 = 5$ and solved it to determine that
the only value of $x$ that makes it true is $x = 3$.

There are some equations that have no solutions, like $x + 1 = x + 2$.
There are also some equations that have more than one solution, like $x^2 = 4$.
In that equation, both $x = -2$ and $x = 2$ work.

Equations can have more than one variable.
For example, if I were to ask you ``Suppose I have two numbers that add up to six'', I would be asking you
to solve the equation $x + y = 6$. (There's many solutions to this: 0 and 6, 1 and 5, 3.5 and 2.5, etc.).

When there is more than one variable, we can draw pretty graphs.
Compare what these two graphs look like: (remember, the graph of an equation is just all the points that satisfy the equation)

% TODO put a cute graph of y = 2x + 1 with y = x^2 + 1

There's a difference between these two equations -- one is a straight line, the other is curvy.
(To be precise, $y = x^2 + 1$ is a parabola).

In linear algebra, we only deal with linear equations.
We don't deal with equations that make parabolas or orther curves\footnote{I should note that many time when a math book uses the word ``curve'' it includes straight lines, since a straight line is a just a curve that doesn't bend at all. When I use the word curve here I mean to exclude straight lines and to only mean things that are, you know, \ldots\ curvy.}.

How can you tell which equation will be a straight line? The exponent on the variables give it away. If the exponent is a one or a zero\footnote{Quick reminder about exponents of zero: $a^0$ will always be $1$, for any value of $a$. One reason why it is this way is to look at the pattern $3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27$. Every time we increase the exponent, we multiply be $3$. Going the other way, we \textit{divide} by $3$, so $3^0 = \frac{3}{3} = 1$. Another reason is that otherwise the exponent rules would break: $x^{a+b} = x^a*x^b$ means that $5^2 = 5^{2+0} = 5^2*5^0$. Therefore $5^0$ must be 1.} it will be straight. If any variable has an exponent besides one or zero it will be curvy.

Examples:
\begin{list}{}
\item $x + 2 = 4$ is a linear equation.
\item $x^2 + 2 = 4$ is not a linear equation.
\item $x + y + z = 3$ is a linear equation.
\item $x + y^1.1 + z = 3$ is not a linear equation.
\end{list}

There's one more thing that can cause an equation to be non-linear: if it contains a non-linear function, then the equation will also be non-linear. Consider the sine function:

%TODO insert graph of a sine function with an arrow show that it's not straight

That's not straight at all! Therefore, an equation like $5 \sin(x) = 5$ is non-linear.

\subsection{Exercises}
Which of the following are linear equations?
\begin{list}{}
\item 1) $3 - x = 2$
\item 2) $3 + 4 -5 + x = 0$?
\item 3) $5 = 5$
\item 4) $0 = 5$
\item 5) $x + y = 2$
\item 6) $x^2 + y = 2$
\item 7) $5x + \cos(x) = 10$
\end{list}
